This repository demonstrates a common error in SQL queries involving the use of aggregate functions like AVG() within the WHERE clause. The incorrect query attempts to compare individual salaries to the average salary, but this results in an error because aggregate functions cannot be directly used this way. The solution demonstrates how to use a subquery to correctly compute the average salary and then compare individual salaries against this value.
